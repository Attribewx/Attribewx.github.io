					I love creating things! It doesn't matter what it is if I'm making it I'll enjoy my time making it. Its so much fun learning things on the way to
					your finished product cause you can look back and just see your growth from the beginning and see where you can improve. If I'm not making something
					I'm probably learning how to make something or just learning something.
				</p>
				<p>	
					I have been very interested in video games ever since I could play them, which was when I turned three. I think they've really shaped who I am
					today. They sent me down a path that I got very interested in which was just computer science in general. I've learned so many things
					that seem difficult but once you dip your feet in, you find out its pretty simple.
				</p>
				<p>	
					Some of my favorite games include: Metroid, Darks Souls, Ratchet and Clank, Hollow Knight, Overwatch, Apex Legends, Rocket League, 
					The Legend of Zelda, Minecraft, Little Big Planet, and too many more.
				</p>
				<p>
					If there was one thing I liked more than games it would definitely be Magic. Not of the gathering, or card tricks type though. 
					But just like Avatar The Last Airbender kinda magic, or something like an RPG's Magic. Just something that looks pretty and does something
					really cool. I like magic because its not something of this world but with some art and engineering you can get something close to it and I
					think thats just absolutely incredible.
				</p>
                
                
                
                <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">About Me</p>
                <p>
                    I love a good challenge. If something is difficult then I will definitely enjoy it because it puts your brain to a test. That test is usually to change
                    your way of thinking of the problem, because no one ever got anywhere doing the same exact thing everytime. Whenever I am challenged by a difficult problem
                    I always try my hardest to match its difficulty with my skill.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    I am probably way too curious for my own good. If I don't know how something works or what something is I will take the time to learn about it if it seems
                    interesting or that it could be useful to know. This is definitely why I am interested in art because I love observing how things work and why they work
                    which helps a lot with drawing weird or just normal things like a simple run animation for a rabbit.
                </p>
